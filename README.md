## Citing TerraTools
We are currently have a JOSS Paper in review, watch [this space](https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues/6488#issuecomment-1997933700).

## Installation

### Requirements
TerraTools requires Python version 3.8 or newer.

If you want to use the map plotting functions (such as `TerraModel.plot_layer`), make sure you have a working installation of [Cartopy](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/installing.html).

* If you are using Python 3.9 or above,
  [installing Cartopy](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/installing.html)
  can be done with `pip install cartopy`, `conda add cartopy`, `poetry add cartopy`
  or equivalent.
* If you have to use Python 3.8, installation of Cartopy using pip requires
  [additional dependencies are met first](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/v0.21/installing.html#required-dependencies).
  On Mac machines, you may find that after you follow the instructions on that site, you still need to add the following command to your `~/.bashrc` or equivalent:
  ```sh
  export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/geos/lib/
  ```

### Pre-installation
If you are using a Conda-like package manager (e.g.,
[Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/) or
[Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)), we recommend always
[creating a new environment](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/concepts.html#concepts)
for each project you are working on into which you install TerraTools.
For instance:
```sh
conda create -n amazing_mantle_convection_project python=3.11
conda activate amazing_mantle_convection_project
```

This is entirely optional but often prevents issues with dependency version
conflicts.

### Installing the latest released version

#### Installation with `pip`
Before installing TerraTools with `pip`, first install and/or upgrade your
version of pip:
```sh
python -m ensurepip --upgrade
```

To install the latest released version of TerraTools, then do:
```sh
python -m pip install terratools
```

#### Installation with dependency management systems
If you use a dependency management system such as
[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) or [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
you should add `terratools` as a dependency of your project.

### Installing the development version

You can also install the latest development version of TerraTools from source. To do this, first clone the repository onto your local machine using git:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/mantle-convection-constrained/terratools.git
```
Then navigate to the top level directory and install in development mode:
```sh
cd terratools; python -m pip install -ve .
```

### Post-installation

Finally, check you have a fully working installation:
```sh
python -c "import terratools"
```
