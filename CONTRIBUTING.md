# Contributing to TerraTools

## Getting started with git and GitHub
GitHub provides a helpful
guide on the process of contributing to an open-source project
[here](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).

## Bug reports
It is a great help to the community if you report any bugs that you
may find. We keep track of all open issues related to TerraTools
[here](https://github.com/mantle-convection-constrained/terratools/issues). 

Please follow these simple instructions before opening a new bug report:

- Do a quick search in the list of open and closed issues for a duplicate of
  your issue.
- If you did not find an answer, open a new
  [issue](https://github.com/mantle-convection-constrained/terratools/issues/new) and explain your
  problem in as much detail as possible.
- Attach as much as possible of the following information to your issue:
  - a minimal set of instructions that reproduce the issue,
  - the error message you saw on your screen,
  - any information that helps us understand why you think this is a bug, and
    how to reproduce it.

## Contributing code
To make a change to TerraTools you should:
- Create a
[fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#fork) (through GitHub) of
the code base.
- Create a separate
[branch](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) (sometimes called a
feature branch) on which you do your modifications.
- Indent your code correctly by executing `./contrib/utilities/indent`
from the main directory.
- Propose that your branch be merged into the terratools
code by opening a [pull request](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).
This will give others a chance to review your code.
- For new functions, write a useful [docstring](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#documentation-strings) in the [Sphinx style](https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docstrings.html).
- For new features (new functions, modules or new options to existing functions), add documentation for them (in `docs`).
- For any new functions or features, add tests to `tests`.
- Take note of [semantic versioning](https://semver.org).  This means that if you want to change the way that terratools works, a new major (X+1.0.0) version of the software will need to be released.  Mention this in your pull request.  Any new features which are backward-compatible require a new minor (X.Y+1.0) version.

## Adding examples
To add a new example script, add it to `examples`, copying the formatting in
one of the existing example scripts (e.g., `examples/example_attenuation.py`).
This include the comment blocks which enable an example script to be rendered
on the documentation website.

Run the script, verify that it works, and copy the correct output to the
`misc/ref` directory.  For example, if your new example is called
`examples/example_cool_new_thing.py`, do the following:

```sh
python examples/example_cool_new_thing.py > misc/ref/example_cool_new_thing.py.out
```

Then run the package tests (see below) to make sure your script when run produces the
expected output.

Once you have done that, add an entry to `docs/copy_ref_examples.py` for
the example script you have added.  This will ensure it is built when the
website documentation is made and its name is added to the list of examples.

## Running tests
To run the tests, in the root directory of the repo do:
```sh
python -m unittest discover tests
```
This will run all the tests and report the results.

## Code conventions
General conventions:
- Module global variables should be prefixed with a `_` unless they are meant to be used by users.  E.g., `plot._CARTOPY_INSTALLED` is not meant to be part of the public interface, but `terra_model.VALUE_TYPE` can be used externally.
- Class attributes should be prefixed with a `_` unless they are meant to be accessed when using an instance of the class directly.  E.g., in `terra_model.TerraModel`, note that `_lon` and `_lat` are attributes but they are not meant to be accessed directly; instead the `get_lateral_points` method is provided.
- Functions which calculate and return something from their arguments should be named by the thing they return.  E.g., `geographic.azimuth` **not** `geographic.calculate_azimuth`.

Certain modules and classes follow specific conventions on names of functions and variables:
- `terra_model.TerraModel`:
  - Functions which return an object which makes up a `TerraModel` instance which can be edited to update the model are prefixed with `get_`.  E.g., `terra_model.TerraModel.get_radii` returns a vector of radii which can be changed, which will change the model.
  - On the other hand, functions which return something which cannot be used to update the model are not prefixed with `get_`.  E.g., `terra_model.TerraModel.evaluate` returns values from the model at a certain point in space.
