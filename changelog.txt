  ## [1.0.0] - 2024-03-08

_First release._
  - Read TERRA NetCDF files into a TerraModel object (or TerraModelLayer object if single layer)
  - Built in methods provide simple access to scalar and vector fields
  - Methods for plotting profiles, layers, slices and flow fields
  - Calculate spherical harmonic coefficients of field using Healpy
  - Tools for generating tables of seismic properties for arbitrary compositions
  - Predict seismic properties of TerraModel
  - Method for detecting mantle plume in TerraModel 

  ## [1.0.1] - 2024-03-12
