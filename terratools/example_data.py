"""
This submodule provides access to example data for TerraTools. Data is
downloaded on first use and stored in a local cache. This is managed
using pooch with file names returned by each of the public functions in
the submodule.

For example, to access the basalt table (in 'example_bas_table.dat')
you could run:

    import terratools.example_data
    filename = terratools.example_data.example_bas_table()

The filename is then the full path to the example data file.
