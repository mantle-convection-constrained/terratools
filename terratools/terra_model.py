class TerraModel:
    """
    Class holding a TERRA model at a single point in time.

    A TerraModel contains the coordinates of each lateral point, the
    radii of each layer, and zero or more fields at each of these points.

    Fields are either 2D (for scalar fields like temperature) or 3D
    (for multicomponent arrays like flow velocity) NumPy arrays.

    There are two kinds of methods which give you information about
    the contents of a TerraModel:

    1. Methods starting with ``get_`` return a reference to something held
       within the model.  Hence things returned
       by ``get``ters can be modified and the TerraModel instance is also
       modified.  For example, ``get_field("vp")`` returns the array containing
       the P-wave velocity for the whole model, and you can update any values
       within it.  You should **not** change the shape or length of any arrays
       returned from ``get_`` methods, as this will make the internal state
       of a TerraModel inconsistent.

    2. Methods which are simply a noun (like ``number_of_compositions``)
       return a value and this cannot be used to change the model.

    Model coordinates
    -----------------
    TerraModels have a number of layers, and within each layer there are
    a number of lateral points, of which there are always the same number.
    Points on each layer at the same point index always have the same
    coordinates.

    Use ``TerraModel.get_lateral_points()`` to obtain the longitude and
    latitude of the lateral points.

    ``TerraModel.get_radii()`` returns instead the radii (in km) of
    each of the layers in the model.

    Model fields
    ------------
    Models fields (as returned by ``TerraModel.get_field``) are simply
    NumPy arrays.  The first index is the layer index, and the second
    is the point index.

    As an example, if for a model ``m`` you obtain the temperature field
    with a call ``temp = m.get_field("t")``, the lateral coordinates
    ``lon, lat = m.get_lateral_points()`` and the radii ``r = m.get_radii()``,
    the temperature at ``lon[ip], lat[ip]`` and radius ``r[ir]`` is given
    by ``temp[ir,ip]``.

    Nearest neighbours
    ------------------
    The nearest lateral point index to an arbitrary geographic location
    can be obtained by ``m.nearest_index(lon, lat)``, whilst the nearest
    ``n`` neighbours can be obtained with ``m.nearest_indices(lon, lat, n)``.
    ``m.nearest_neighbours(lon, lat, n)`` also returns the distances to
    each near-neighbour.

        Construct a TerraModel.

        The basic TerraModel constructor requires the user to supply a set
        of radii ``r`` in km, and a set of lateral point coordinates as
        two separate arrays of longitude and latitude (in degrees).
        These then define the 2D grid on which the field values are defined.

        Fields are passed in as a dict mapping field name onto either a
        2D array (for scalar fields like temperature), or a 3D array
        for multicomponent fields, like flow velocity or composition histograms.

        Composition histograms enable one to translate from temperature,
        pressure and composition to seismic velocity by assuming the
        model contains a mechanical mixture of some number of different
        chemical components, and performing Voigt averaging over the
        elastic parameters predicted for these compositions, weighted
        by their proportion.  The field ``"c_hist"`` holds a 3D array
        whose last dimension gives the proportion of each component.
        At each depth and position, the proportions must sum to unity,
        and this is checked in the constructor.

        When using a composition histogram, you may pass the
        ``c_histogram_names`` argument, giving the name of each component,
        and ``c_histogram_values``, giving the composition value of each.
        The ith component name corresponds to the proportion of the ith
        slice of the last dimension of the ``"c_hist"`` array.

        Seismic lookup tables should be passed to this constructor
        when using multicomponent composition histograms as a ``dict``
        whose keys are the names in ``c_histogram_name`` and whose values
        are instances of ``terratools.lookup_tables.SeismicLookupTable``.
        Alternatively, ``lookup_tables`` may be an instance of
        ``terratools.lookup_tables.MultiTables``.

        :param lon: Position in longitude of lateral points (degrees)
        :param lat: Position in latitude of lateral points (degrees).  lon and
            lat must be the same length
        :param r: Radius of nodes in radial direction.  Must increase monotonically.
        :param surface_radius: Radius of surface of the model in km, if not the
            same as the largest value of ``r``.  This may be useful
            when using parts of models.
        :param fields: dict whose keys are the names of field, and whose
            values are numpy arrays of dimension (nlayers, npts) for
            scalar fields, and (nlayers, npts, ncomps) for a field
            with ``ncomps`` components at each point

            composition histogram, passed as a ``c_hist`` field
        :param c_histogram_values: The values of each composition of the
            composition histogram, passed as a ``c_hist`` field

            ``lookup_tables.MultiTables``

            (the radius in km) and returns pressure in Pa.  By default
            pressure is taken from PREM.  The user is responsible for

            range of the model.
